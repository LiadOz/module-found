## Description
You know what really pisses me off? That stinking "ModuleNotFound" error in Python. Why the hell should I have to scrounge around PyPI like a goddamn scavenger hunt looking for packages made by smelly nerds? Python should just know what the hell I'm trying to import!

That's where module-found comes in. This badass package tells Python to cut the crap and stop whining about missing modules. Instead of throwing a tantrum, Python rolls up its sleeves and gets shit done. How? By using AI, that's how!

With module-found, Python ain't playing games. It's like having a personal assistant that knows exactly what you need, even before you do. No more wasting time trying to find the right package, just install module-found, sit back, and let Python do the heavy lifting.

So, to all you smelly nerds out there, listen up: if you want to stop annoying people like me with your dumbass "ModuleNotFound" errors, do us all a favor and get on board with module-found. Otherwise, you're just a bunch of useless turds making life harder for the rest of us.

## Installation
```bash
pip install module-found
```

## Setup
By default, this package is supposed to be smart enough to handle shit on its own. It'll look for an environment variable called MODULE_FOUND_KEY and use that as the OPENAI API key. But guess what? Python's too dumb to figure that out, so you might have to hold its hand a bit.
```bash
export MODULE_FOUND_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

If you're too lazy to set up the environment variable (I don't blame you), you can call the setup function yourself and pass in your API key. It's like Python's throwing a tantrum, so you gotta give it what it wants.

Here's how you do it:
```python
from module_found import setup

# If you're too lazy to set up the environment variable, just do this:
setup(your_api_key)
```
But seriously, who the hell wants to do extra work? Python should just know what the hell to do, am I right? It's like dealing with a goddamn toddler who can't tie their own shoelaces.

So, do yourself a favor and set up that stupid environment variable. Or don't, and suffer through calling the setup function like a chump. Your call.

## Usage
Listen up, you bunch of nerds! I'm about to show you how to work some goddamn magic:

```python
from cs_interview_questions import pascal_triangle

pascal_triangle(10)
```

You see this? We just imported a package out of thin air, thanks to module-found! This cs_interview_questions package? It wasn't even on the radar until we brought it into existence. And then, like a boss, we fire up the pascal_triangle function, giving it the old 10 treatment. It's like coding on steroids, without all the brain-busting gibberish. So grab your popcorn, 'cause we're about to blow your mind!
